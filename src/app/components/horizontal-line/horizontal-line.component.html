<p class="jxr_linenumber p-4">For each win or tie, you will receive 5 points multiplied by the level. Conversely, for each loss, 10 points multiplied by the level will be deducted.
    To win the round, you must reach a score of 3. If the computer's score reaches -3, you will lose the round.
    If you win, you will receive 30 points multiplied by the level, and if you lose, that same amount will be deducted.
