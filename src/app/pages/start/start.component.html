        Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand gesture game that is enjoyed by people of all ages. In this game, players choose one of three symbols - rock, paper, or scissors - to represent their move, and the outcome is determined based on the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
        In the version of the game with different levels of difficulty, players can challenge themselves to beat increasingly tougher opponents as they progress through the levels. The game offers five different levels of difficulty, each with its own unique characteristics and challenges.
